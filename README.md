# Portfolio Website

My personal website and a personal project to challenge myself to build a website with ReactJS frontend while using Redux, Sass and NodeJS with Express for the backend after one
or two online courses.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I already have the same website made from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JS with JQuery ðŸ¤¯ [HERE](https://github.com/CrestNiraj12/Final-Website-Assignment)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Sets NODE_ENV to production and runs the server to start responding for requests.

### `npm azure`

Sets NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION to false then,

- #### `npm install --prefix client`

  Installs client dependency packages

- #### `npm run build --prefix client`

  Runs the build script of client

- #### `node backend/config/utils/optimizeImages.js`

  Optimizes and Resizes images for better performance. Makes use of [imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin) package that uses the following plugins to optimize:

  - [imagemin-pngquant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-pngquant)
  - [imagemin-mozjpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-mozjpeg)

  For resizing, [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) package is used.

### `npm run dev`

Uses [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) package. Runs 3 scripts:

- #### `nodemon server`

  Starts the server using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to start responding for requests
